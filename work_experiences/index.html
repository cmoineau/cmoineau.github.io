			<h3>Description of the internship :</h3>
			<p>
				As part of my final year internship, I worked at <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/"></a>IRISA</a>'s laboratory in the team <a href="http://www-shaman.irisa.fr/">SHAMAN</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://people.irisa.fr/Gregory.Smits/">Grégory SMITS</a>.
				The goal of the internship was to improve a method to generate linguistic summaries of a big database.
				A linguistic summary is a set of fuzzy properties such as "most crow are black".
				To generate such a summary, the classic approach requires to go through the whole database, which results in a linear complexity depending of the size of the database. 
				The complexity is also exponential depending of the size of the vocabulary. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The team <a href="http://www-shaman.irisa.fr/">SHAMAN</a> had written two papers for a method that uses metadata which are stored in the database management system.
				While their method has a perfect precision for atomic properties, it has some flaw for conjonctive properties (for example: "Most crow are black and tall").
				First, I conducted a bibliographic study in order to understand what caused this flaw. 
				Among the several solutions that I suggested, the used of multidimensionnal histogram was chosen. 
				From this point onwards, I implemented three multidimensionnal histograms (<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.45.75">MHIST</a>, 
				<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2459804_Approximating_Multi-Dimensional_Aggregate_Range_Queries_Over_Real_Attributes">GENHIST</a> et 
				<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/stholes-a-multidimensional-workload-aware-histogram/">STHOLES</a>) using Python (3.6.9) and I compared them with one another. 
				In order to make it easy to carry on with my work, I created a dockerized API using <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a> before ending my internship.
			</p>

			<h3>Conclusion :</h3>
			<p>
				This internship has allowed me to improve my scientific papers reading and analyzing skills.
				Due to the COVID-19 epidemy, I had to work mostly from home. This gave me the opportunity to develop my autonomy and to telecommute for the first time.
				I have also discovered some underlying problematics of the reasearch world, such as the reproductiblity of the results of scientific papers.

			<h3>Description of the internship :</h3>
			<p>
				During summer 2019, I spent 2 months at the <a href="https://www.nctu.edu.tw/en/">National Chiao Tung University</a> (NCTU) Taiwan in the <a href="http://soc.ee.nctu.edu.tw/">Intelligent Electronics and System-On-Chip</a> (IESOC) laboratory.
			</p>

			<p>
				During these 2 months, I have worked on detecting emotion using ECG (Electrocardiogram) and PPG (Photoplethysmogram) signals. For this I used CNN (convolutional neuronnal network) with the library <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a> (v2.24). This also made me work on issues such as peak detection and real time implementation. Indeed, at the end of the internship I had to implement my CNN on the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit">JetSon Nano board</a>.

			<h3>Conclusion :</h3>
			<p>
				This internship was a very good first experience of the world of research. I can't thank enough the people that welcomed me at the NCTU and made these two months such a beneficial experience. I have been able to understand the difficulties related to working in a research laboratory. Even if the thematic was not in the scope of what I have done at school, I was really eager to learn. These two months confirmed my desire to do research.

			</ul>

			<h3>Description of the internship :</h3>
			<p>I spend 2 months during summer 2018 at the <a href="http://www.orleans-metropole.fr/">Orléans Métropole</a> at the Information Systems Division (ISD). This summer, I worked on two different topics.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li> Establishement of a supervision using the <a href="https://www.centreon.com/en/solutions/centreon/">OS Centreon</a>. I arrived during the fusion between the services of every ISD of the metropole. In this contexte, the ISD of Orléans decided to upgrade their supervision services. During this internship I have been able to witness a real network. I have learned many things about network and virtualization.
				</li>
				<li> Management of the Active Directory (AD). The AD of the metropole had a lot of users who were supposed to be gone. My work was to found these users and to remove them. This project was really interresting since I had to create a way to detect users who aren't supposed to have an active directory with the information given by the AD. For this I used Power Shell script.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Conclusion :</h3>
			<p>
				This was my first technical internship. I have learnt a lot, and I was given responsabilities. Most particularly for the cleaning of the AD, where a mistake could have lead to the supression of a worker's account.
