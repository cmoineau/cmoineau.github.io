<h2>BomberBall</h2>
    <h3>General context</h3>
    <p>
        Bomber Ball was an important project for software engineering course.
        During this project, we were role playing a company and the professors were playing the client. 
        During this project we respond to a call for tender, and create various meetings with our fictive company in order to respond to the fictive client's demand.
        The clients wanted to create a video game similar to the Bomber Man.
        To accomplish this task we were a team of 6 students.
    </p>

    <h3>Main takeaway</h3>
    <p>
        This project learnt me a lot about working with other peoples (more than 2) and the different issues we can face when integrating pieces of code together.
        One of the main issue was communication between the different subteam we created and we soon realized the importance of creating an development documentation.

        We experimented different development cycle with our teachers which were roleplaying clients.
        We were very invested in this project has it was a long one (5 months) and the creative aspect of it make it even more fun.

        Indeed, we had a lot of freedom during this project, the only constraints being to create a Bomberman like game and to write the code in Java.

        And here you can watch a small video we made to show the result during the final presentation :
