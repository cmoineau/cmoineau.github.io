<h2>BomberBall</h2>
    <p>
        Bomber Ball was an important project for software engineering course. During this project, we were role playing a company and the professors were playing the client. 
        During this project we respond to a call for tender, and create various meetings with our fictive company in order to respond to the fictive client's demand. The company wanted to create a video game similar to the Bomber Man. We had to code the game in Java since it was the language we used the most in junior year at ENSSAT.
