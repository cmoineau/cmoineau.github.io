    	<h2 id="NCTU">Internship at the NCTU 2019</h2>
    		<h3>Description of the internship :</h3>
    		<p>
    			During summer 2019, I spent 2 months at the <a href="https://www.nctu.edu.tw/en/">National Chiao Tung University</a> (NCTU) Taiwan in the <a href="http://soc.ee.nctu.edu.tw/">Intelligent Electronics and System-On-Chip</a> (IESOC) laboratory.
    		</p>

    		<p>
    			During these 2 months, I have worked on detecting emotion using ECG (Electrocardiogram) and PPG (Photoplethysmogram) signals. For this I used CNN (convolutional neuronnal network) with the library <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a> (v2.24). This also made me work on issues such as peak detection and real time implementation. Indeed, at the end of the internship I had to implement my CNN on the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit">JetSon Nano board</a>.

    		<h3>Conclusion :</h3>
    		<p>
    			This internship was a very good first experience of the world of research. I can't thank enough the people that welcomed me at the NCTU and made these two months such a beneficial experience. I have been able to understand the difficulties related to working in a research laboratory. Even if the thematic was not in the scope of what I have done at school, I was really eager to learn. These two months confirmed my desire to do research.

    	<h2 id="Metropole">Orléans Métropole 2018</h2>
    	    <h3>Description of the internship :</h3>
    		<p>I spend 2 months during summer 2018 at the <a href="http://www.orleans-metropole.fr/">Orléans Métropole</a> at the Information Systems Division (ISD). This summer, I worked on two different topics.
    		</p>
    		<ol>
    			<li> Establishement of a supervision using the <a href="https://www.centreon.com/en/solutions/centreon/">OS Centreon</a>. I arrived during the fusion between the services of every ISD of the metropole. In this contexte, the ISD of Orléans decided to upgrade their supervision services. During this internship I have been able to witness a real network. I have learned many things about network and virtualization.
    		    </li>
    			<li> Management of the Active Directory (AD). The AD of the metropole had a lot of users who were supposed to be gone. My work was to found these users and to remove them. This project was really interresting since I had to create a way to detect users who aren't supposed to have an active directory with the information given by the AD. For this I used Power Shell script.
                </li>
    		</ol>
    		<h3>Conclusion :</h3>
    		<p>
    			This was my first technical internship. I have learnt a lot, and I was given responsabilities. Most particularly for the cleaning of the AD, where a mistake could have lead to the supression of a worker's account.
